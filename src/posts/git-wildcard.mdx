Did you know when staging your files for Git, you can use the wildcard to target specific directories/files?

### An example

Let's say you have these files ready to be committed:

```bash
modified:   app/features/cart/index.ts
modified:   app/features/cart/cart.test.ts
modified:   app/features/cart/cart.module.css
modified:   public/assets/favicon.ico
modified:   README.md
```

You only want to `add` and `commit` the files in `app/features/cart`. You could opt to add them individually, or maybe you could just YOLO it and and run `git add .`. The other and more preferable option would be to use the wildcard symbol and target the files in `/cart`:

```bash
git add app/features/cart/*
```

This isn't just for directories, you could also target files that have different extensions. Let's say we just want to target all file names that contain `app/components/header/header`:

```bash
modified:   app/components/header/header.ts
modified:   app/components/header/header.test.ts
modified:   app/components/header/header.module.css
modified:   app/constants/api/index.ts
modified:   .gitignore
```

We'd just need to place the wildcard symbol before the final dot:

```bash
git add app/components/header/header.*
```
